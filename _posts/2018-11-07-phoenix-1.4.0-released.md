## What is phoenix?
<img src="/assets/tech/phoenix.png" width="50px">

Phoenix is a web development framework written in Elixir which implements the server-side Model View Controller (MVC) pattern. Many of its components and concepts will seem familiar to those of us with experience in other web frameworks like Ruby on Rails or Python’s Django.

Phoenix provides the best of both worlds - high developer productivity and high application performance. It also has some interesting new twists like channels for implementing realtime features and pre-compiled templates for blazing speed.

If you are already familiar with Elixir, great! If not, there are a number of places to learn. The Elixir guides and the Elixir learning resources page are two great places to start. We also have a list of helpful resources to learn more about Phoenix and some of the projects it depends on.

The aim of this introductory guide is to present a brief, high-level overview of Phoenix, the parts that make it up, and the layers underneath that support it.

Phoenix is made up of a number of distinct parts, each with its own purpose and role to play in building a web application. We will cover them all in depth throughout these guides, but here’s a quick breakdown.
- Endpoint
    - the start and end of the request lifecycle
    - handles all aspects of requests up until the point where the router takes over
    - provides a core set of plugs to apply to all requests
    - dispatches requests into a designated router
- Router
    - parses incoming requests and dispatches them to the correct controller/action, passing parameters as needed
    - provides helpers to generate route paths or urls to resources
    - defines named pipelines through which we may pass our requests
    - Pipelines - allow easy application of groups of plugs to a set of routes
- Controllers
    - provide functions, called actions, to handle requests
    - actions:
        - prepare data and pass it into views
        - invoke rendering via views
        - perform redirects
- Views
    - render templates
    - act as a presentation layer
    - define helper functions, available in templates, to decorate data for presentation

- Templates
    - files containing the contents that will be served in a response
    - provide the basic structure for a response, and allow dynamic data to be substituted in
    - are precompiled and fast

- Channels
    - manage sockets for easy realtime communication
    - are analogous to controllers except that they allow bi-directional communication with persistent connections
- PubSub
    - underlies the channel layer and allows clients to subscribe to topics
    - abstracts the underlying pubsub adapter for third-party pubsub integration
