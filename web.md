I got into web development mainly by completing the awesome railstutorial by michael hertl. When I joined @pocketworks I got the option to do more web stuff. I've done a couple of webprojects for our clients using the phoenix framwork/elixir. Although frontend is not my primary focus, I can use bootstrap or build an SPA with react/vuejs.
