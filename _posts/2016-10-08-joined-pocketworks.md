I've joined [Pocketworks](https://pocketworks.co.uk) today as an intern. This year is going to be exciting.

Here's the story of pocketworks: 

>Our company was founded by Tobin Harris in 2012 when he noticed that most business apps were failing at getting traction and results. Although he didn't have all the answers, Tobin wanted to give companies a better chance at success.

>Since starting the company 6 years ago, our first three apps are still in use today, one transacting over Â£30m a year, and all are still under active development at Pocketworks. This is what success looks like to us - helping our clients make good choices, invest wisely and ultimately make their customers and staff more productive in some way or another
